# Envy DOS Subsystem

This repo contains the source code for the Envy DOS Subsystem. This is a direct fork of the MS-DOS 4.0 Source Code now publicly available by Microsoft. 

# Why an archive?

Git (and GitHub) by default makes all files UTF-8. DOS does NOT like UTF-8, and we have to preserve the older style of text (ASCII) so DOS can compile successfully.
